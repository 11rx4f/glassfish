no_impl=DTrace is not available.  This can be caused by two things:\n\
 1. JDK 7 is required to run DTrace\n\
 2. glassfish-dtrace.jar value-add is required for DTrace
not_supported=DTrace is not available.  This condition normally only occurs when your\n\
Operating System does not support DTrace.  Currently you must have Solaris 10\n\
or better for dtrace support.
init_ok=DTrace is connected and ready.
habitatNotSet=Internal Error: habitat was not set in {0}
enabled DTrace enabled is set to {0}\n
