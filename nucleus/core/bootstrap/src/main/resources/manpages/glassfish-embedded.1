NAME
       glassfish-embedded - Start GlassFish Embedded as an executable JAR

SYNOPSIS
    java -jar glassfish-embedded-all.jar ${ARGUMENTS}

DESCRIPTION
    GlassFish Embedded can be executed as an executable JAR file. This starts
    the server and configures it according to the given arguments or
    configuration files.
    If executed without arguments or if no application is deployed, the server is
    started and waits for further admin commands in a loop. The server can be
    terminated with the "exit" or "quit" commands or pressing Ctrl+C.

OPTIONS
${OPTIONS}

Any argument that doesn't start with a hyphen (-), is treated as follows:

- If it's a file or directory, it's deployed at startup as an application. If it's
  the only application deployed at startup, it's deployed under the root context '/'.
  Otherwise it's deployed under the context root derived from the name of the file
  or deployment descriptors.
- In all other cases, the argument is executed as a GlassFish admin command.
  Individual commands must be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces. GlassFish
  admin commands arethe same commands supported by GlassFish Server's "asadmin"
  command line tool or by the "CommandRunner" Java class in GlassFish Simple Public API.

DEFAULT CONFIGURATION

    By default, GlassFish Embedded is started with the following configuration:

     - HTTP listener enabled on port 8080
     - HTTPS listener disabled
     - If "glassfish.properties" file exists in the current directory, properties
       in this file are set as if the "--properties=glassfish.properties" argument
       was defined

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: Run an application from command line
        On port 8080 and root context by default

        java -jar glassfish-embedded-all.jar app.war

    Example 2: Run an app on a different port

        java -jar glassfish-embedded-all.jar --httpPort=8090 app.war

    Example 3: Run a custom deploy command on startup
        Sets a custom root context. Custom commands need to be enclosed in quotes
        if they contain spaces.

        java -jar glassfish-embedded-all.jar "deploy --contextroot=/app app.war"

    Example 4: Run 2 applications from command line
        Deploys applications on different context roots, based on the file name
        or info in the application descriptors.

        java -jar glassfish-embedded-all.jar app1.war app2.war

EXIT STATUS
    0
        GlassFish shut down successfully

    1
