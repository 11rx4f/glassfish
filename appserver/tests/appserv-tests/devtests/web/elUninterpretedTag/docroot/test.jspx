    <p>
    When param.test is not set, for jsp pages the attribute value is an empty 
    string if printed to output. <br />
    When using jspx (jsp document) the string"null" is in the output instead.
    <br />

    Observe the difference:<br />
    In template text: ${notDefined}

    but displayed as "null" here:<br />
    <myTag value="${notDefined}" />
