To test "deploy --force=true .rar"
To test "undeploy --cascade=true rarname"

This test is similar to redeployRAR test, difference being we do not undeploy first version of
connectors-ra-redeploy-rars.rar and deploy second version of connectors-ra-redeploy-rars.rar.
Instead we do  "deploy --force=true" for second version of connectors-ra-redeploy-rars.rar without
undeploying first version of connectors-ra-redeploy-rars.rar
deploy --force=true should undeploy the first version of resource-adapter, its resources,
resource-adapter-config and use the second version's connectors-ra-redeploy-rars.rar,
use the same resource-adapter-config and recreate the resources

This test is executed twice to make sure that "undeploy --cascade=true rarname" works fine.
Second run will try to create same resource which will fail in case the resource by the name exists.
Resource types include : Connector-connection-pool, connector-resource, admin-object-resource, resource-adapter-config


How to run :

pwd :(force-deploy-rar directory)
ant all
