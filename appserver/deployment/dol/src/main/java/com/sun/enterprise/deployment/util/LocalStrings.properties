enterprise.deployment.util.multiple_ejbs_with_interface=Cannot resolve reference [{0}] because there are [{1}] ejbs in the application with interface {2}. \nSome of the possible causes: \n1. The EJB bean class was packaged in an ear lib library (or through any other library mechanism which makes the library visible to all component modules), this makes all the component modules include this bean class indirectly. \n2. The EJB bean class was packaged in a component module which references the EJB, either directly or indirectly through Manifest, WEB-INF/lib. \nThe EJB bean class should only be packaged in the declaring ejb module and not the referencing modules. The referencing modules should only include EJB interfaces.
