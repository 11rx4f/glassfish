        Unfortunately, we've used two naming patterns for methods, and we
        can't change everything to use the same pattern because some classes
        implement standard APIs.  It's choice between having consistent
        naming of the addUrlPattern method across all classes, or having
        consistent use of "Url" vs. "URL" in method names in a single class.
        We choose the latter.
